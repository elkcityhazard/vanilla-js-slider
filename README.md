# vanilla-js-slider

This is my own implementation of the "infinite scroll" slider.  It aims to be accessible, but also minimal - more as a foundation for projects, than a complete implementation.

## Features

- Button Navigation
- Tab Navigation
- Touch Navigation
- Auto Scroll
- Pause On Hover

## Libraries Used
- None


Feel free to use it in your own project, or if you need help customizing it, let me know.
